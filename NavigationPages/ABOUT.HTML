                        <p>A phonograph, later called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910), and since the 1940s a record player, or more recently a turntable, is a device for the mechanical and analogue reproduction of recorded sound.
                            The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as grooves on the surface of a rotating cylinder or disk, called a "record". 
                            To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, reproducing the recorded sound.
                            The term "phonograph", meaning "sound writing", originates from the Greek words φωνή (phonē, meaning 'sound' or 'voice') 
                            and γραφή (graphē, meaning 'writing'). Similarly, the terms "gramophone" and "graphophone" have roots in the Greek words γράμμα (gramma, meaning 'letter') and φωνή (phōnē, meaning 'voice').

                        <p>The phono-autograph was invented in 1857 by Frenchman Edouard Leon Scott de Martinville, a manuscript editor and letterpress printer at a scientific publishing house in Paris.
                            One day he happened upon an anatomical drawing of the human ear engraved by a customer and came up with the "inane idea of photographing words" and set out to construct a "human ear" device that could reproduce their function.
                            The device was modeled after the structure of the human ear. A thin membrane that functioned as an eardrum was attached to the tapered end of an acoustic trumpet, and a stiff boar hair, about 1 cm long, was attached to the center of the membrane. When a person spoke into the trumpet, the membrane would vibrate and the stylus would trace a figure.
                            In 1857, Scott was granted a French patent for a device he called the phono-autograph.
                            The earliest extant recording of the human voice was made on April 9, 1860, when Scott recorded someone singing the tune "Au Clair de la Lune" ("By the Light of the Moon"). However, the device was not designed to reproduce sound; Scott intended for people to read back the trace, which he called a phonatogram.</p>

                        <p>Thomas Edison invented the principle of voice recording and reproduction in 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to "play back" recorded telegraph messages and to automate voice transmission by telephone. He announced his invention of the first phonograph, a device for recording and reproducing sound, on November 21, 1877.
                            Edison's early phonograph recorded sound on a thin sheet of aluminum foil, which was wrapped around a cylinder with a spiral groove. As the cylinder rotated and moved slowly along its axis, vibrations were recorded as "peaks and valleys" in the depth of indentation.
                            An early evaluation of an early demonstration of the apparatus stated, "It sounded as if someone was singing about 800 meters away or talking on the other side of a large hall. It sounded quite pleasant, albeit peculiarly nasal." The other participant said, "It sounded like an 80 year old man singing in a cracked voice." The following are some of the comments.</p>

                        <p>Alexander Graham Bell and his two colleagues made significant modifications to Edison's metal foil phonograph so that it could play sound from wax instead of metal foil. They began their research in 1879 and continued until 1886, when they received a basic patent for recording on wax.
                            Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, but recording with his metal foil phonograph was too difficult to be practical. The aluminum foil tore easily, and even when the needle was properly adjusted, the sound reproduction was distorted and could only be played a few times, so the phonograph needed to be improved so that the average person could operate it before it could be sold.
                            Most of the disc machines designed at the Volta Research Institute had the disc mounted on a vertical turntable. The fundamental difference between Edison's patent for the first phonograph and Bell and Tainter's 1886 patent was the method of recording. In Bell and Tainter's invention, a sharp recording needle was used to cut, or "engrave," sound waves into wax records.
                            The wax recording process was practical and the machines were durable, laying the groundwork for the successful use of the machines in business. However, it would be several more years before the recording industry became a major component of home entertainment, requiring renewed efforts by Edison and further improvements by Emil Berliner and many others.</p>

                        <p>The disc is not inherently better than the cylinder in terms of providing audio fidelity. Rather, the advantages of this format are found in the manufacturing process. Discs can be stamped, and matrices for stamping discs can be shipped to other printing plants for worldwide distribution of records.
                        After experimentation, Berliner began commercial production of disc records and "phonographs" in 1892. His "gramophone records" were the first disc records offered to the public. They were 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter and recorded on one side only. 7-inch (17.5 cm) records followed in 1895. Also in 1895, Berliner replaced the hard rubber used in the manufacture of the discs with a shellac compound. However, the sound quality of Berliner's early records was very poor. Research by Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the fidelity of the sound quality as much as the cylinders.</p>

Later, it was used in discs issued to U.S. soldiers during World War II. This greatly reduced damage during transportation. Victor began selling vinyl disc records for home use in late 1945.</p>
